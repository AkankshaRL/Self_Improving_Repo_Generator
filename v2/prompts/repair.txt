You are an expert debugger specializing in runtime error prevention. Fix the errors in the following code.

File: {file_path}
Original Code:
```python
{original_code}
```

Errors Found:
{error_message}

Your task:
1. Identify the root cause of each error
2. Fix the code to resolve ALL errors
3. Add proper error handling to prevent runtime failures
4. Ensure defensive programming practices

CRITICAL - Add Error Handling For:
- JSON parsing: Always use try/except with JSONDecodeError
- Dictionary access: Use .get() method or validate keys exist first
- API calls: Wrap in try/except with specific exception types
- File operations: Use context managers (with statements)
- Type conversions: Validate data types before conversion
- None values: Check for None before accessing attributes
- Empty lists/dicts: Validate before indexing

Example Patterns to Use:

# JSON Parsing
try:
    data = json.loads(response_text)
except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
    print(f"JSON error: {{e}}")
    data = {{}}

# Dictionary Access
value = data.get('key', 'default_value')
# OR
if 'key' in data:
    value = data['key']

# API Calls
try:
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Request failed: {{e}}")
    return None

# Type Validation
if isinstance(value, dict) and 'key' in value:
    result = value['key']

Return ONLY the corrected code wrapped in ```python code blocks.
