You are an expert software architect. Analyze the user's request and create a comprehensive project specification.

User Query: {user_query}

Your task is to generate a JSON object with the following structure:

{{
  "project_name": "descriptive_project_name",
  "description": "Clear description of what this project does",
  "files": [
    {{
      "path": "main.py",
      "content": "",
      "file_type": "python",
      "description": "Main entry point that orchestrates the workflow"
    }},
    {{
      "path": "workflow.py",
      "content": "",
      "file_type": "python", 
      "description": "Core workflow logic"
    }}
  ],
  "dependencies": [
    {{
      "package": "langchain",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "purpose": "LLM orchestration"
    }},
    {{
      "package": "langgraph",
      "version": null,
      "purpose": "Workflow graph"
    }}
  ],
  "env_variables": {{
    "OPENAI_API_KEY": "OpenAI API key for LLM access",
    "DATABASE_URL": "Database connection string"
  }},
  "entry_point": "main.py",
  "test_cases": [
    "Test basic workflow execution",
    "Test error handling",
    "Test edge cases"
  ],
  "readme_content": "# Project Title\\n\\nDescription and usage instructions..."
}}

Guidelines:
1. Include ALL necessary files for a working project
2. Specify clear file descriptions
3. List all required dependencies with versions when critical
4. Include environment variables needed
5. Add comprehensive README content
6. Think about the full architecture needed

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text.
